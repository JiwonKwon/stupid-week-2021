- Hi, guys, nice to meet you. I'm your guide, Jeff.
- There are eleven people on this tour today. So, I guess everyone's here now.
- When are we going to come back to the hostel?
- Around 6 p.m. Oh, you're wearing a short-sleeved shirt. It'll be a little bit cold inside.
- Did you bring a jacket by change?
- Of course.

- (on the bus to the cave) Do you always stay at hostels?
- Not always. When I really need to relax all by myself, I go to hotels.
- Have you ever tired "couch surfing"?
- No, I haven't. I'm not certain if that is safe.
- Better safe than sorry. I've done that several times before.
- For me, it was a good way to learn about different cultures.

- Now, are you guys ready to explore the cave?
- YES!!
- Nice. You'll have an unforgettable time here today.
- Here are the helmets, overalls, and lamps. Please choose the right size for yourself.
- Can we put our belongings in the locker?
- Yes, please. And wear the locker key around your wrist.

- Aren't you going anywhere during this vacation?
- Where should I go? I should spend time with my family on vacation.
- Really? I was going to suggest you go on a trip to Europe with me if you have time.
- A tip together?
- Flight tickets and expenses will be very expensive.
- Yes, my air miles are near to expiry, so I have to use them on Lunar New Year's Day.
- So, are you going on a trip to Europe for free?
- Yes, I was actually wondering if you'd like to come with me because the mileage is transferable.
- Oh, that's too bad. I've got to see my parents during this vacation.
- Okay, I'll try to find another friend then.

- Don't forget to check your tire pressure on a regular basis.
- Why is that? How often should I do that?
- Oh, every few months is sufficient.
- Doesn't it take time?
- Not really! It takes only a few minutes, and you'll avoid having flat tires.
- Okay, then I'll make sure to check my car tires regularly.
- Yes, it will save you time and money in the long run.
- And you can check your tire at any car center.
- Then, I should go to the car center tomorrow as you mentioned.

- Do you like your new job?
- Not really. There aren't any advantages of it except being close to home.
- But given that you're still working there, I think it's not that bad.
- I'd have quit earlier if it wasn't for the rent.
- So, are you going to find another job?
- I don't know. I don't have many choices anymore.
- You should also consider setting into where you work.
- That's one of my remaining options. Thank you for your advice.
