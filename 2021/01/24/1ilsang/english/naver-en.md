- That mountain looks beautiful. Have you ever hiked up to the top of that mountain?
- Of course! That is my all-time favorite place to hike.
- In the wintertime, the peaks are covered with snow. It's breathtaking.
- Do you take a water bottle with you?
- No, there's a fresh spring about halfway up that mountain.

- Speaking of which, shall we hike the mountain?
- Right now? Okay. Why not?
- Let me change into some comfortable clothes.
- And don't forget to put on some sunscreen, Dad. This one is a lotion, and this one is a spray.
- Which one is lighter?
- Neither one is too heavy. It doesn't really matter which one you use.

- Eddy, Thanks for coming to see me.
- There's something I need to get off my chest.
- So, you and your husband haven't talked for over a week?
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes, two samgyetang soups, please.
- Okay. I'm sorry, but would you please pay up front?
- Oh, sure. Here's 20,000 won.
- Why do you carry your TV remote?
- Hahaha, I thought this was the most evil thing I could do to him.

- Did you go to the party on Friday?
- Yes, I did. And something embarrassing happened as soon as I arrived.
- I didn't have any gifts prepared in advance, so I thought I didn't have anything to offer.
- So, what did you do for the gift?
- As a shopping center happened to be nearby, I bought some Chinese tea as a gift!
- Good job! You chose well considering you were in a hurry.
- I was going to give it to everyone in attendance.
- But there wasn't enough to give to everyone who came.
- Oh no. If you couldn't give it to everyone, you should have given out a few quietly.
- Yes, that's true. It's my mistake.

## 0122

- We'll have to change our schedule.
- Why, what's the problem?
- The people who are supposed to deliver the piano can't come today.
- Is it because we are trying to pay for the piano on credit?
- Hmm... It could be.
- So are they delivering the piano or not?
- They didn't say anything about it.
- We need a piano for our kid's lessons. What should we do?
- I'm not sure.

## 0123

- Aren't you going to keep your promise to pay back the money you borrowed?
- I'm sorry. I forgot because I was so busy.
- I'll pay you back this week for real!
- Do you know it's the third time you've said that?
- I know. But believe me. I'm really busy these days.
- Even so, it's quite ridiculous.
- I really have done wrong. I'll pay you back this week.
- This could make our relationship go sour.
- Well, I'll trust you for the last time.
