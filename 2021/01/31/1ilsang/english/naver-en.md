- Wow, that was the best chicken soup ever!
- See? I told you. When it comes to food, Korea is like haven.
- So, please keep telling me what happened.
- When we've got an issue, I want to talk about it.
- But my husband doesn't want to say anything.
- Actually, I'm one of those types of people.
- We prefer to be alone and think about the problem.
- Oh, my... you sound like my husband.

- Last week, my husband's phone was broken.
- And he had to wake up early in the morning the next day.
- So, did he ask you to wake him up?
- Nope. He didn't want to be the first to break the silence.
- Then?
- He put a piece of paper on the table saying, "Please wake me at 4:30 a.m."
- So... you woke him up at 4:30?
- No, I didn't. I put a sticky note on the side of the lamp saying, "It's 4:30. Wake up!"

- What's that look? Yeah... I know we're both childish.
- But what can I do? Being married is totally different from dating.
- When did that start? What did you have an argument about?
- Coffee. It started when we wanted to have coffee.
- You and your husband started arguing because of coffee?
- Can you be more specific?
- It was about who should make the coffee.

- I'm so nervous these days.
- What's wrong?
- I heard a rumor that the company might close.
- I heard that too. I think it'll be hard to run a company.
- I thought I'd last longer, so I can't believe it.
- Well, we'll still have to find another job just in case.
- Yes, I'm planning to, but that's not easy either.
- Me, too. I don't have many certificates.
- Oh, I've never gotten a certificate, either.
- We both need to study in our spare time.

- I met James on Sunday, and I was surprised.
- We went to eat pizza, and he ate three slices of pizza by himself!
- That's not surprising. He usually eat more than four.
- He always eats the most pieces and is the last one to finish.
- That's right. He eats the most among his friends.
- He even said that he eats late-night snacks every night.
- Isn't it amazing how slim he is?
- That's what I mean.

- Why are you so tired?
- I didn't get enough sleep last night.
- I can tell. What did you do till late at night?
- I watched a drama series all night. I feel sorry for that now.
- You brought it on yourself.
- I think it's better not to do the same thing next time.
- I know, but I can't sleep well at night.
- Why don't you start exercising?
- Sure, working out might help me sleep better at night.
- That's been my experience. Exercise definitely helps you to sleep more soundly.
