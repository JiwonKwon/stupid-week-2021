- Nick, thanks to the mental age test, I now want to live life like a young person again.
- I don't think you have to try.
- You're already living that young life, aren't you?
- I'll sign up for a yoga class and a soap-making class.
- Are you interested in one of the two?
- Actually, I'm interested in both of them.
- Alright. Then let me call and check the availability.

- Nick, they said the yoga class was full right now.
- Then let's start with soap making.
- Great. The instructor told me to get a bar of soap base.
- A bar of soap base? Let me check on the Internet.
- Wow, there are a lot of choices here.
- Can you find TEA-free soap base?
- Because TEA is something that can be bad for our skin.

## 0303

- Check it out. These are what we made.
- How was today's class? Did you like it?
- Yes, I really liked it. I especially liked all those oils, which smelled so good.
- What's your favorite herb oil?
- I like lavender. I've always liked a lavender bubble bath.
- Oh, we're going to make a bubble soap bar next time.
- Sounds nice! I'll make an extra one for my daughter.

## 0304

- How are you doing these days?
- Sometimes, I just want to throw everything away and run away.
- I understand that feeling.
- Ah! What's wrong with my life?
- There's nothing I can do, I can't do as I please.
- You have to accept what you have to accept.
- Let's see what we can do first.
- Do you think we can?
- Of course.
- You seem to believe in something after all.

## 0305

- Did you have trouble with your boss again?
- Yes, I think I'll be leaving earlier than scheduled.
- Did you find a new job?
- No. Now I'm hastily deciding because of my boss.
- Calm down. If I were you, I'd get anther job and quit.
- That's a good idea.
- But I don't think we need to talk about this at work.
- Of course, let's keep it quiet.
- Yeah. There's nothing good if the boss knows about it.
- Thank you for your practical advice.

## 0306

- How's your new job going?
- Well, I think it's very special company.
- What do you mean?
- I work at the coffee during the first and second week of every month.
- And then I have to work at home during the third and fourth weeks.
- Wow, that doesn't sound very stable.
- Yes, I can't get used to any patterns.
- I've never heard of that type of work.
- The new atmosphere is good on the other hand.
- Everything's new.
