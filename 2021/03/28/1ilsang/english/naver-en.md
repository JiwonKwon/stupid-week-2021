- Hey, look at you! You look totally different today.
- Thanks to you, Min. Thanks for helping me with shopping.
- It's good to have a friend who is good at shopping.
- Ask me for help anytime.
- Wow, that shirt fits you perfectly.
- I feel more confident in this outfit.
- People say that you are what you wear.

- Did you do your hair by yourself?
- Yes, how do I look? Do I look okay?
- Yes, you look gorgeous!
- Thanks. I followed one of the video clips you sent me.
- It's windy, but how come your hair doesn't move at all?
- I don't like it when my hair is tangled.
- So, I used a strong hair spray to make my hair stay in place.

- Since we had a light lunch, I feel hungry.
- Do you want to have some cookies?
- No, thanks. I'm trying to cut down on carbs.
- I love noodles, cookies, and burgers, but no thanks.
- Are you on a diet again?
- Of course. Rather than losing weight, I want to be healthier.
- And I want to age well.

- You look great to day! Did you buy new clothes?
- Yes! I bought it at the most famous A brand store.
- It looks really good on you!
- I want to take a look at that store, too!
- Can you go with me?
- Sure, let's go together!
- But that brand has become so popular that it will be crowded.
- When is the least crowded time to shop there?
- I don't know. It's always crowded.

- Hello, I'm looking for a new book.
- What kind of book are you looking for?
- It's a book on humanities, titled "About Conversation".
- Oh, yes, we have the humanities on display here in the middle of the bookstand.
- Yes, but I don't think it's here.
- Oh! We haven't gotten any new books yet.
- I'll stop by in a few days then.
- If you leave your contact information, we'll let you know as soon as it comes in.
- Thank you. Here's my phone number.

- Excuse me, I'm sorry, but your typing on the computer is too loud.
- Really? I always work on the computer here.
- This is a public place, so I hope you'll be quiet.
- There is a separate computer room in the library.
- Is that so? Where is the computer room?
- Yes, if you go out to the entrance of the library, you'll see a sign saying, 'Computer Room'.
- I see. I guess I passed by it on the way in.
- Yes, i'm sure you'll find it.
- Ok, thanks for the information.
