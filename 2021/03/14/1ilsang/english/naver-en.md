- I think I'm smelling the lavender already.
- Besides lavender, we'll make some oatmeal soap, too.
- Oatmeal? I eat oatmeal with warm milk for breakfast.
- Right, that kind of oatmeal.
- Oatmeal is also well known for its moisturizing properties.
- That's what I need.
- My skin feels drier in the winter season.

- Mom, I saw a parrot speaking English on TV.
- He said, "hi", "Good morning", and "No."
- Parrots are very good at mimicry.
- Then they don't really know what they're saying?
- Maybe not. They just mimic what people say.
- But there was a special parrot who lived until it was 30.
- Why was the parrot special? Did he speak Korean?
- Hahaha, no. But he was capable of real communication.

- Mom, what do you want me to be when I grow up?
- There's not any particular job that I want you to get.
- My dream keeps changing.
- That's very normal. The world also keeps changing.
- Some jobs might disappear due to A.I.
- And there'll be other new jobs in the future, right?
- Of course. So, stay curious and read many books on a variety of topics.
- Most of all, I want you to be happy, Jun.

- Honey, why am I so tired?
- Mostly because you're doing something nonstop.
- You are running a company, and you're getting a degree as well.
- Am I going too far?
- That's probably true, but I don't want you to give up on your dream.
- Don't forget the weekend, thought.
- Thanks. I'm glad you're so understanding.
- It's for us. Let's go for a walk on the weekends.
- You need a break, too.

- How was your day today?
- Oh, so-so.
- Yesterday was much better as I got to teach a class with children.
- Really? What's wrong today?
- I feel heavy, today.
- I got so many text messages last night that I got up late this morning.
- I understand that feeling.
- One day you're up, and the next day you're down. It happens a lot.
- Yep, I'm waiting for tomorrow to be a less distracting day.
- Don't worry even if things always change. Most of them get better.

- How's your new team's office?
- Well, it's as normal as the former office.
- I thought it would be special because of the new location.
- Offices are all the same.
- I'm not very happy moving because it's a hassle.
- I see. You don't know unless you experience it.
- I can't wait for my work to get back on track.
- I hope you don't work overtime because of the move.
