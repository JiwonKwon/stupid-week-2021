- It's always good to be in the library or at a bookshop.
- I know. I'm happy when I'm surrounded with books.
- Eddy, can you get that book from the top shelf?
- This one? Okay. Here you are.
- Thanks. I've been waiting for this author's new novel for so long.
- Novels aren't really my thing.
- Well, to each their own.

- Now we should get going.
- Will you drop me off at the subway station?
- I can take you to your home. It's Friday.
- Oh, cool. Thanks.
- Put on some relaxing music.
- Alright. And I'll turn on the heater too.
- Yes, please. It's freezing today.

## 0401

- Good morning, Arman. How are you doing?
- I'm good. You sound like you're full of energy.
- Really? maybe because I slept like a baby last night.
- My new pillow helped me not toss and turn.
- I can't sleep that well because of my little kids.
- I wish I could sleep without being disturbed.
- But they're adorable, right?

## 0402

- Hello sir, what are you looking for?
- Yes, I'd like to get a leather wallet.
- Okay, we have many kinds of leather wallets here.
- Can I look at some brown ring types, please?
- Well, I'm sorry that there aren't any brown wallets.
- That's too bad.
- I'm sorry, I'll make sure we have some the next time you come.
- Sure, thank you.

## 0403

- Good evening, may I help you?
- Sure, I'd like to make a reservation for a night.
- Would you like a single room or a double?
- A single room, please.
- How much will that be?
- That's $60 per night.
- Do you take any credit cards?
- We take Master, Visa and American Express.
- Here it is.
- Please let me know if you need anything anytime.

## 0404

- May I see your driver's license and registration, please?
- What's the problem, officer?
- You didn't stop at the stop sign completely and just passed it.
- Oh, I didn't know that well.
- You should always stop at the stop sign, and this is a school zone.
- Oh, yes, I am so sorry.
- I'll always stop at the line from now on.
- Since it's your first time, I'll charge you the penalty at the lowest rate.
