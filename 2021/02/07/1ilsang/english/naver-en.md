- Jin, let's have some coffee.
- Sure. But you should make it. I need to do my makeup.
- What are you talking about? 
- You’re in charge of everything in the kitchen. 
- No way! That’s your job! Men should always make coffee. 
- It's in the Bible. 
- I don’t believe you. Where is that written?
- Look at this page. It says... “HEBREWS.”

- Bomi, what is this on the sticky note? 
- Which one? Oh, that one on my planner? 
- That’s my new password for websites I use. 
- Come on. How can you be so careless? 
- Are you letting everyone see it? 
- They don’t know my ID, so what’s the problem? 
- As one famous CEO once said, “Passwords are like underwear. 
- Do not share them with strangers.”

- I got it. I won’t let people know my password. 
- How often do you change your passwords? 
- Once a year, maybe? 
- If I change them often, I easily forget my new passwords. 
- You can use a password manager. 
- Then you don’t need to worry about forgetting your passwords. 
- As long as I make passwords long, they will be safe, right? 
- Try to make them strong and unique.

- Oh my gosh! I can't see the TV well. 
- Did your eyesight get worse? 
- I guess so. I can't even read a book clearly. The letters are blurry. 
- I need glasses. 
- Get your eyesight tested quickly before your eyesight gets worse. 
- Once they get worse, it’s hard to get better. 
- Isn’t it because I got old? 
- We're too young to be old! 
- That’s right! I should take a nutritional supplement that is good for eyesight.

- Would you have lunch with me? 
- Well, I think I'll probably stay in the library today. 
- Aren't you going to have lunch then? 
- I'm going to have a simple paprika salad. 
- Are you trying to lose weight? 
- Yeah. I've gained a lot of weight lately. 
- Why? How did you suddenly gain weight? 
- I guess it's because I'm just sitting all day while studying under stress. 
- I'm sure you're having a hard time with less exercise. 
- Yeah. I don't have time to exercise, so I’ll watch what I eat.
