- Wow, it's good to be back in Switzerland!
- You've been here before?
- Yes, three times. But I couldn't wait to come here again.
- Welcome to this amazing country!
- Tell me. When you think of Switzerland, what comes to your mind?
- Maybe... a watch, a Swiss Army Knife, and breathtaking scenery?
- But there's just one downside to visiting this country.
- What's that?
- I heard that everything is super expensive.

- Luckily, there are a lot of ways for budget travelers to save money.
- Did you get the Swiss Travel Pass by chance?
- Travel Pass? I was thinking of renting a car.
- My friends told me about a train that I can ride on in my car.
- Yes, you're right. Well, it's up to you.
- But think about it.
- The Swiss have the world's best railroad system.
- You don't even need a car to get around!
- The views from the trains are amazing.

- I'm certain that I made the right choice. Thanks.
- Thank you. I'm happy to have a travel buddy.
- By the way, they speak three languages in Switzerland, right?
- Yes, French, Italian, and German.
- And they also have their own Swiss version of German.
- Do you speak any of those three languages?
- I can speak just a little bit of French. You?
- I know just a little bit of German.

- I think Michael and Ben had a fight.
- Those two haven't changed.
- They've always had a tit-for-tat relationship.
- But this time, I think it's a bit different. They look serious.
- They never had a serious fight. It's a surprise.
- Do you know what happened?
- I think Michael's joke was over the line.
- Oh, no. He wouldn't have meant it.
- I think so, too.
- I just hope Ben doesn't get him wrong.

- Hi. how are you doing?
- Oh, I'm doing fine. I live in Southern California.
- That's great. How's the weather there?
- It's great. I always go swimming whenever I have a chance.
- I see. What do you do in California?
- Well, I am attending school here again.
- Really? Why did you go back to school?
- I just wanted to get a degree all of a sudden.
- Can you tell me what degree it is?
- Sure. It's a degree in Marine Economy.

- How was your practice at the kindergarten during the vacation?
- Indeed. It was so nice.
- So I'm still doing it even though the vacation is over.
- It's hard, but I think it suits my aptitude.
- You're already preparing for your degree in Early Childhood Education.
- You're going to be a kindergarten teacher after graduation, aren't you?
- That's right. I think I chose my major well.
- I am jealous of you for finding what you want to do.
